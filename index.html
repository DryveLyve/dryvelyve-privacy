        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 30, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how DryveLyve, developed by Nicholas Hudson ("we", "us", or "our"), operates entirely on your device to track mileage and manage expenses.</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do not collect, transmit, store, or access any of your trip, expense, location, or personal information on external servers. Everything remains private on your device. This policy explains which device permissions we request and how they are used exclusively for local processing.
        </div>

        <h2>What Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any identifying information on external servers</li>
            <li><strong>No Location Data Transmission:</strong> Your GPS coordinates and trip routes never leave your device</li>
            <li><strong>No Financial Data Transmission:</strong> Expense records, mileage rates, and earnings calculations stay on your device</li>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app requires no registration, login, or user profile</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics services that track your behavior or app usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Functionality</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve runs continuously (24/7) in the background to automatically detect and track driving trips. All data processing occurs locally on your device with no external transmission of your trip, location, or expense data.</p>

        <h2>Optional Crash Reporting and User Feedback</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve includes optional features that allow you to send crash reports and feedback directly to the developer:</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> When the app crashes, you will be prompted with an option to send a crash report via your email app. This is entirely optional and requires your explicit action.</li>
            <li><strong>Email-Based:</strong> Crash reports are sent through your device's email app (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) - you can review the entire report before sending.</li>
            <li><strong>No Automatic Transmission:</strong> Nothing is sent automatically. You must manually choose to send the report.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Button:</strong> The app includes a "Send Feedback" button in Settings that allows you to voluntarily email the developer with questions, issues, or suggestions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Crash Reports Contain</h3>
        <p>If you choose to send a crash report, it includes only technical diagnostic information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device manufacturer and model (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S21")</li>
            <li>Android version (e.g., "Android 13")</li>
            <li>App version number</li>
            <li>Crash timestamp</li>
            <li>Technical error details (stack trace)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Crash Reports Do NOT Contain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No GPS coordinates or location data</li>
            <li>No trip history or mileage records</li>
            <li>No expense amounts or financial information</li>
            <li>No photos or receipt images</li>
            <li>No personal identifying information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Developer Use of Crash Reports</h3>
        <p>Crash reports you voluntarily send are used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and fix bugs in the app</li>
            <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
            <li>Respond to user-reported issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The developer (Nicholas Hudson) does not share, sell, or distribute crash report information to any third parties.</p>

        <h2>Device Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>The following permissions are required for the app to function. All permissions are used exclusively for local processing on your device:</p>

        </ul>

            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Display trip status, tracking alerts, and mileage goal notifications</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Keep you informed about trip detection and app status</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Notifications are displayed locally on your device only</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Boot Permission (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Automatically restart trip tracking when your device reboots</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Ensures continuous tracking without manual intervention</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> No data is accessed or transmitted during boot</li>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve uses Google Play Billing for subscription management:</p>
        <ul>
