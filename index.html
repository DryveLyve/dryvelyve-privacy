        <h1>DryveLyve Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="effective-date">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 30, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 30, 2025<br>
            <strong>Developer:</strong> Nicholas Hudson<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Spring Hill, Tennessee, United States
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve is committed to your complete privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application operates entirely on your device to track mileage and manage expenses.</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do not collect, transmit, store, or access any of your trip, expense, location, or personal information. Everything remains private on your device. This policy explains which device permissions we request and how they are used exclusively for local processing.
        </div>

        <h2>What Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any identifying information</li>
            <li><strong>No Location Data Transmission:</strong> Your GPS coordinates and trip routes never leave your device</li>
            <li><strong>No Financial Data Transmission:</strong> Expense records, mileage rates, and earnings calculations stay on your device</li>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app requires no registration, login, or user profile</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics services that track your behavior or app usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Functionality</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve runs continuously (24/7) in the background to automatically detect and track driving trips. All data processing occurs locally on your device with no external transmission of your trip, location, or expense data.</p>

        <h2>Device Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>The following permissions are required for the app to function. Each permission is used only for local data processing:</p>

        <h3>Location Permissions (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> Calculates trip distances using GPS</li>
            <li><strong>Background Location:</strong> Enables 24/7 automatic trip detection when the app is closed or device is locked</li>
            <li><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Location coordinates are processed and stored only on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your location is never transmitted to external servers or accessible to us</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Camera Permission (Optional)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Capture photos of receipts for expense tracking</li>
            <li><strong>When Used:</strong> Only when you choose to add a receipt photo</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Photos are stored locally on your device only</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can decline camera permission and still use all other app features</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Storage Permission (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Save receipt photos, export trip reports, and maintain local database</li>
            <li><strong>Local Database:</strong> All trip and expense data is stored securely in a local database on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Export Files:</strong> Generated reports are saved to your device for sharing, printing, or emailing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Network/Internet Permission (Limited Use)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription Verification Only:</strong> The app verifies your subscription status with Google Play Billing but does not transmit your personal information, trip data, or location data</li>
            <li><strong>WiFi Detection:</strong> Detects WiFi for printer discovery and background tracking optimization</li>
            <li><strong>Local Printer Access:</strong> Discovers WiFi-enabled printers on your local network</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Upload:</strong> Trip data, location data, and expense data never leave your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Activity Recognition Permission (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Detects when you are driving, walking, running, or stationary</li>
            <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> Uses accelerometer and gyroscope to identify vehicle movement patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Prevents false trip triggers (walking with your phone won't start a trip)</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> All activity recognition processing occurs locally using Google's Activity Recognition API</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Boot/Startup Permission (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allows the app to restart automatically after your device reboots</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures continuous 24/7 trip tracking even after device restarts</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable auto-start in your device settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Battery Optimization Permission (Requested)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevents Android from stopping background trip tracking to save battery</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Disable battery optimization for DryveLyve to ensure reliable trip detection</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can decline this permission, but trip detection may be interrupted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Notification Permission (Required on Android 13+)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Display persistent notification during trip tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Required by Android:</strong> Foreground services must show a notification</li>
            <li><strong>Information Shown:</strong> Trip status, distance, and tracking state</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
        <p>All data is stored in a local database on your device. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trip records (start/end location names, distance, duration, classification)</li>
            <li>Expense records (amount, category, date, description)</li>
            <li>Receipt photos (stored in app-specific storage)</li>
            <li>User preferences (mileage rate, notification settings, units)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Device Security:</strong> Modern Android devices automatically encrypt all app data. We recommend enabling device encryption and using a strong screen lock for additional protection.</p>

        <h2>Data Export and Sharing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can export your data at any time in CSV or Excel format</li>
            <li><strong>Export Process:</strong> Files are generated locally and saved to your device storage</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> You choose when and how to share exported files (email, cloud storage, printing)</li>
            <li><strong>No Automatic Upload:</strong> We never automatically upload or sync your data to external servers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Subscription and Payment Processing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> All subscription and payment processing is handled entirely by Google Play Store</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Verification:</strong> The app only verifies your subscription status with Google Play Billing - it does not transmit your personal information, trip data, or location data</li>
            <li><strong>No Payment Data:</strong> We never see or store your credit card information, billing address, or payment details</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous to Us:</strong> We cannot identify individual subscribers or link subscription payments to specific devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for subscription verification and Activity Recognition API</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics services</li>
            <li><strong>No Advertising:</strong> We do not use advertising networks or tracking pixels</li>
            <li><strong>No Social Media:</strong> We do not integrate with social media platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve is designed for use by individuals who need to track vehicle mileage for business or tax purposes. The app is not directed at children under 13. Subscription purchase requires users to be at least 18 years old or have parental/guardian consent for payment through Google Play Store. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, as all data remains stored locally on the user's device.</p>

        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve is currently available in the United States only. Since all data processing occurs locally on your device with no external transmission, there are no international data transfers or cross-border data flows. Your data never leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Security Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored exclusively on your device, protecting your device protects your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable device encryption (automatic on most modern Android devices)</li>
            <li>Use a strong screen lock (PIN, pattern, password, or biometric)</li>
            <li>Enable remote device wipe capabilities (Find My Device)</li>
            <li>Export and backup data regularly</li>
            <li>Keep your device OS and apps updated</li>
            <li>Report lost or stolen devices to your carrier immediately</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect your data, you have complete control:</p>
