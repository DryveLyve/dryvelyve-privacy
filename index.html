        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: December 8, 2025<br>Last Updated: December 8, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve ("we", "us", or "our") is a mileage tracking app that collects and processes location data locally on your device to automatically track your driving trips for mileage logging and business expense tracking.</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <strong>Key Privacy Principle:</strong> All data collected by DryveLyve is stored and processed locally on your device. We do not transmit, upload, or have access to your trip data, location history, or personal information on external servers. This policy explains how your device permissions are used for local processing only.
        </div>

        <h2>What Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        
        <div class="data-collection-note">
            <strong>Location Data (Collected):</strong> We collect and process your GPS coordinates and trip routes to calculate mileage and track your driving trips. This location data is collected continuously in the background, even when the app is closed or not in use. All location data is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> GPS coordinates and trip routes are collected continuously in the background to automatically detect and record driving trips. This data is processed and stored exclusively on your device for mileage calculation and trip tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Recognition Data:</strong> Motion and activity data from your device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) is collected to detect when you start and stop driving. This helps prevent false trip triggers and ensures accurate trip detection. All processing occurs locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information such as operating system version and app version is collected for functionality purposes. This data stays on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Trip Records:</strong> Start/end times, locations, distances, durations, and trip classifications (business/personal) are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Expense Records:</strong> Amounts, categories, dates, descriptions, and receipt photos are stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Data We Do NOT Collect or Transmit</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No External Transmission:</strong> Your GPS coordinates, trip routes, and location data never leave your device or get transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information Collection on Servers:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any identifying information on external servers</li>
            <li><strong>No Financial Data Transmission:</strong> Expense records, mileage rates, and earnings calculations stay on your device</li>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app requires no registration, login, or user profile</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics services that track your behavior or app usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Functionality</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve runs continuously (24/7) in the background to automatically detect and track driving trips. All data processing occurs locally on your device with no external transmission of your trip, location, or expense data.</p>

        <h2>Optional Crash Reporting and User Feedback</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve includes optional features that allow you to send crash reports and feedback directly to the developer:</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> When the app crashes, you will be prompted with an option to send a crash report via your email app. This is entirely optional and requires your explicit action.</li>
            <li><strong>Email-Based:</strong> Crash reports are sent through your device's email app (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) - you can review the entire report before sending.</li>
            <li><strong>No Automatic Transmission:</strong> Nothing is sent automatically. You must manually choose to send the report.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Button:</strong> The app includes a "Send Feedback" option in Settings that allows you to voluntarily email the developer with questions, issues, or suggestions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Crash Reports Contain</h3>
        <p>If you choose to send a crash report, it includes only technical diagnostic information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device manufacturer and model (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S21")</li>
            <li>Android version (e.g., "Android 13")</li>
            <li>App version number</li>
            <li>Crash timestamp</li>
            <li>Technical error details (stack trace)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Crash Reports Do NOT Contain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No GPS coordinates or location data</li>
            <li>No trip history or mileage records</li>
            <li>No expense amounts or financial information</li>
            <li>No photos or receipt images</li>
            <li>No personal identifying information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Developer Use of Crash Reports</h3>
        <p>Crash reports you voluntarily send are used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and fix bugs in the app</li>
            <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
            <li>Respond to user-reported issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DryveLyve does not share, sell, or distribute crash report information to any third parties.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store user data on our servers, we have nothing to disclose in response to legal requests. If compelled by law enforcement or legal process, we can only provide publicly available information (app description, features, privacy policy).</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>DryveLyve is designed for users who are 18 years of age or older who perform gig work or need to track vehicle mileage for business or personal purposes. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18 years of age. Since all data remains stored locally on the user's device, we have no access to any user data regardless of age.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your data security is maintained through:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> Protect your device with a strong PIN/password/biometric lock. If your device is lost or stolen, your DryveLyve data is only as secure as your device lock screen.</p>

        <h2>Data Security Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored exclusively on your device, protecting your device protects your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable device encryption (automatic on most modern Android devices)</li>
            <li>Use a strong screen lock (PIN, pattern, password, or biometric)</li>
            <li>Enable remote device wipe capabilities (Find My Device)</li>
            <li>Export and backup data regularly using the in-app export feature</li>
            <li>Keep your device OS and apps updated</li>
            <li>Report lost or stolen devices to your carrier immediately</li>
