        <h2>DryveLyve Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>DryveLyve is a mileage tracking app that collects and processes location data locally on your device to automatically track your driving trips for mileage logging and business expense tracking.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Privacy Principle:</strong> All data collected by DryveLyve is stored and processed locally on your device. Your trip data, location history, and personal information are never transmitted externally. This policy explains how your device permissions are used for local processing only.</p>

        <h3>What Data We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
        <p><strong>Location Data (Collected):</strong> DryveLyve collects and processes your GPS coordinates and trip routes to calculate mileage and track your driving trips. Location data is collected continuously while the app is running in the background. If you swipe the app off your screen, it will continue running in the background and collecting data. However, if you force close the app through your device settings, background data collection will stop until you reopen the app. All location data is stored only on your device and is never transmitted externally.</p>
        <p><strong>Activity Recognition Data (Collected):</strong> DryveLyve collects motion and activity data from your device sensors to detect when you start and stop driving. This helps prevent false trip triggers and ensures accurate trip detection.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Information (Collected):</strong> DryveLyve collects basic device information such as device manufacturer, model, operating system version, and app version. This information is used solely for error logging and troubleshooting purposes, and is only sent to DryveLyve if you choose to submit a crash report or feedback via email.</p>

        <h3>What Data We Do NOT Collect or Transmit</h3>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No External Transmission:</strong> Your GPS coordinates, trip routes, and location data never leave your device</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> DryveLyve does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any identifying information</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No Financial Data Transmission:</strong> Expense records, mileage rates, and earnings calculations stay on your device</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app requires no registration, login, or user profile</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No Analytics:</strong> DryveLyve does not use analytics services that track your behavior or app usage</p>

        <h3>App Functionality</h3>
        <p>DryveLyve is designed to run continuously (24/7) in the background to automatically detect and track driving trips. When you swipe the app off your screen, it remains active in the background. To completely stop background tracking, you must force close the app through your device settings or revoke location permissions. All data processing occurs locally on your device with no external transmission of your trip, location, or expense data.</p>

        <h3>Optional Crash Reporting and User Feedback</h3>
        <p>DryveLyve includes optional features that allow you to send crash reports and feedback directly to the developer:</p>
        
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>User Control:</strong> If the app crashes, you will be prompted with an option to send a crash report via your email app. This is entirely optional and requires your explicit action.</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>Email-Based:</strong> Crash reports are sent through your device's email app (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) - you can review the entire report before sending.</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>No Automatic Transmission:</strong> Nothing is sent automatically. You must manually choose to send the report.</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>Feedback Button:</strong> The app includes a "Send Feedback" option in Settings that allows you to voluntarily email the developer with questions, issues, or suggestions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What Crash Reports Contain:</strong></p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• Device manufacturer and model (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S21")</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• Android version (e.g., "Android 13")</p>

DryveLyve does not share, sell, or distribute crash report information to any third parties.</p>

        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>Your Control:</strong> This feature is controlled entirely by you through your device's Settings → Google → Backup. DryveLyve does not control when or whether backups occur</p>
        <p class="bullet-item">• <strong>Your Data:</strong> Backed up data is stored in your personal Google account. DryveLyve has no access to this data</p>
